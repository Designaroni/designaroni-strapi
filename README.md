# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

### `Environment variables`

Copy .env.example to .env

```
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=['', '']
JWT_SECRET=
API_TOKEN_SALT=
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=
```

Generate `APP_KEYS`, `JWT_SECRET`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` by running Node in the terminal and using `crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64')`.

- `APP_KEYS` must be an array defined like `APP_KEYS=['asdf1234==', 'qwer5678==']`
- `JWT_SECRET`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` can be left as `ENV_VAR=asdf1234==` without the array or string characters
