# Pre-getting started

If this is your first time running the repo locally you may need to install python version 3x in order to successfully run `yarn` which will break when installing better-sqlite3 without the right version of python:

- install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
  - follow the instructions printed in the terminal to add brew to your path
- install pyenv: `$ brew install pyenv`
  - further details on pyenv installation can be found here on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71957847/13986111
  - check the latest python versions here: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
- add pyenv shims to your path
  - ```
    #### adds python
    export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/shims:$PATH"
    ```
- install the latest stable version of python and set it as your global python
  - `$ pyenv install 3.11.0`
  - `$ pyenv global 3.11.0`
  - test which version is installed by running `pyenv version`

# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

### `Environment variables`

Copy .env.example to .env

```
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=['', '']
JWT_SECRET=
API_TOKEN_SALT=
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=
```

Generate `APP_KEYS`, `JWT_SECRET`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` by running Node in the terminal and using `crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64')`.

- `APP_KEYS` must be an array defined like `APP_KEYS=['asdf1234==', 'qwer5678==']`
- `JWT_SECRET`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` can be left as `ENV_VAR=asdf1234==` without the array or string characters
